How can I visualize this data? 

What do I want to find out? And what visualizations could reveal this? 
  It'd be interesting to see how the volume of each main character's dialogue evolves over time
  Currently I'm thinking a stacked bar chart, where each bar represents one episode 
  Or maybe a grouped bar chart. 
  A stacked bar chart would also reveal the total volume of dialogue per episode, 
    while a grouped bar chart would better reveal the differences in dialogue volume between each character. 
  I think the additional visualization of total volume is worth it, though.
