How can I visualize this data? 

What do I want to find out? And what visualizations could reveal this? 
  It'd be interesting to see how the volume of each main character's dialogue evolves over time
  Currently I'm thinking a stacked bar chart, where each bar represents one episode 
  Or maybe a grouped bar chart. 
  A stacked bar chart would also reveal the total volume of dialogue per episode, 
    while a grouped bar chart would better reveal the differences in dialogue volume between each character. 
  I think the additional visualization of total volume is worth it, though. 

Actually, I don't think I should do this based on lines. I should do this based on total words. 
I also need a script to change the data 
  So for each episode I need...
    An object with each character's name mapped to the total number of words they spoke 
  I'm thinking I can store this in a giant json file
    It can just be a giant array with an object representing each episode 
  Ok, yeah this is good stuff
